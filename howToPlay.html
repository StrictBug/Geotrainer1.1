                <p><strong>Single Player Mode:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Select an area and the number of rounds from the menu.</li>
                    <li>For each round, a location name is displayed, and you have 15 seconds to place a marker on the map by clicking.</li>
                    <li>Try to place your marker as close as possible to the actual location.</li>
                    <li>After each guess, the actual location is revealed, and your distance is calculated in kilometers.</li>
                    <li>Aim for the lowest average distance across all rounds.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Multiplayer Mode:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Host a Game:</strong> Enter your name, choose an area and number of rounds, and create a game to get a unique code.</li>
                    <li><strong>Join a Game:</strong> Enter the game code and your name to join other players.</li>
                    <li>Compete with others to guess locations as accurately as possible within 15 seconds per round.</li>
                    <li>Tip: Always submit a guess rather than letting the timer expire â€” no guess scores zero, while an approximate guess can still earn points.</li>
                    <li>See everyone's scores after each round, with distances within 1000km getting points.</li>
                    <li>The player with the most points at the end wins!</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Have fun and sharpen your geography skills!</p>
